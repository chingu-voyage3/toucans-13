		 <div class="p1"><strong>Ticky</strong>Bot is a Slack Bot ðŸ¤– that lets you use support tickets
			  on Slack. This way, you don't need to leave your beloved channel to assist
				your users, if you don't feel like it.</div>
		 <div class="p2">With <strong>Ticky</strong>Bot you can easily check if you've received new tickets,
			  change their status, or write a reply, and the ticket will instantly update
				itself on our site.</div>
		 <div class="p3">Support requests shouldn't be handled through Slack's direct messages.<br>
		 <em>Image about someone asking silly questions and the workplace admin asking him/her to
		 open a support ticket so other admins could look into the issue.</em></div>
